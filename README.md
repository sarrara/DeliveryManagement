# DeliveryManagement
This project is coded with springBoot framework it contains CRUD of Bill and Delivery
I used 3 APIs in this project (Twilio, MapBox, librepdf)
Twilio allows you to generate SMS to track the status of the delivery if it is (delivered, cancelled, pending...) 
MapBox allows you to calculate the time and distance between 2 places once you have given the coordinates of each place and finally librepdf to generate PDF the receipt of each delivery
